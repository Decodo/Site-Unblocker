## Introduction

Site Unblocker is a powerful scraping solution with automatic proxy pool management and automated unblocking capabilities that enable you to access any website with even the most sophisticated anti-bot system.

It bypasses CAPTCHAs, geo-blocking, IP blocking, and other challenges to fetch raw HTML with JavaScript data.

Site Unblocker is ideal for saving costs on development and infrastructure maintenance.

## Authentication

Once you have an active Site Unblocker subscription, you can try sending a request right from the dashboard Site Unblocker > Proxy Setup tab simply by entering the desired website URL and clicking on Send Request. You will also see an example of curl request and live view rendering of the HTML website right below. 

You may also click on the Advanced Parameters tab to access all available parameters for your request, such as custom cookies, custom headers and a JavaScript rendering toggle.
